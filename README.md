# Recurrio  

Do you enjoy grocery shopping? No? Neither do we. I mean, who likes going to the local supermarket to buy more or less the same stuff again and again, week after week? It's 2017, come on. By now, houses should be able to restock themselves without the need for humans to remember the milk. 
That's why we are building Recurrio, the only solution that restocks your house automatically, forever.
